   <h3><u>Why America Should help World Hunger</u></h3>

<img  src =“ForeignAid.png“ alt =“Foreign Aid Bar Graph“>

   

   <p=”paragraph1”>The reason why America should help World hunger is because almost 900 million people in America and other underdeveloped countries around the world are facing extreme world hunger. Zimbabwe for example, the U.S. provides 70% of Zimbabwe's food aid. This Shows how much of a impact that the U.S. has on many underdeveloped countries if the U.S. didn't help. the population could take a severe crash, mostly because these underdeveloped countries do not have enough resources or food to support the population.

</p>

<h3><u>Why America Shouldn't Help World Hunger</u></h3>


<p=”paragraph2”> America shouldn't Help World Hunger because they are currently, as of 2018 $21.516 Trillion in debt. This means that every time they donate, yearly or monthly means they will continually go deeper and deeper into debt. Also There is too little accountability for those who abuse U.S. aid through theft or misuse.

</p>

<h3><u>My Opinion</u></h3>


<p= “opinion”>My opinion is split, because if the U.S. stops aiding undeveloped countries the world population will take an almost immediate population drop, which could very well keep the population in check. I also think they shouldn't help world hunger because the U.S. is currently $21.516 trillion in debt. This is a problem because a certain percentage of the U.S.'s income is going towards world hunger when it could be going elsewhere. Finally, I believe that the U.S. should help because, every life is important and has a purpose, plus in the end life is so much  more important than money
